# TrainYouLife - Management of Food and Exercise Plans
This application was designed to be multiplatform, that is, it can be used to its full potential, regardless of the device or operating system that the user uses. In a general perspective, the application will allow a registered user to consult a series of exercises and foods and will have access to essential information that will be useful in the creation of their training plans and diet. The application does not limit the user's choices; the user is free to formulate the plans he wants, always having feedback from the application, which will allow him to have an estimate of the nutrients he will consume.

In addition to creating these plans, the application allows the user to control their weight and view their progress over time. Every day, the user will be able to register his weight and the application will present its evolution in the form of graphs, in order to make the visualization of the information more pleasant and intuitive.

This application was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript, with the aid of PHP to connect to a database. In order to allow the application to run on all types of platforms, we used the GoRatchet framework, a Javascript framework.
